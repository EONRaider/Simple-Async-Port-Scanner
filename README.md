A simple pure-Python TCP Connect port scanner. This application leverages
the use of Python's Standard Library `asyncio` framework to execute a
number of TCP connections to an arbitrary number ports on target IP
addresses, taking a maximum time equal to the connection `timeout`
setting (defaults to 10 seconds) to return all results.

This application maintains no dependencies on third-party modules and can be
run by any Python v3.7+ interpreter.

## Installation

### GNU / Linux

Simply clone this repository with `git clone` and execute the
`async_tcp_scan.py` file as described in the following
[Usage](#usage) section.

```
user@host:~/DIR$ git clone https://github.com/EONRaider/Simple-Async-Port-Scanner.git
```

## Usage

```
usage: async_tcp_scan.py [-h] -p PORTS [--open] ADDRESSES

Simple asynchronous TCP Connect port scanner

positional arguments:
  ADDRESSES             A comma-separated sequence of IP addresses and/or domain names to scan, e.g., '45.33.32.156,65.61.137.117,testphp.vulnweb.com'.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORTS, --ports PORTS
                        A comma-separated sequence of port numbers and/or port ranges to scan on each target specified, e.g., '20-25,53,80,443'.
  --open                Only show open ports in the scan results.

Usage examples:
1. python3 async_tcp_scan.py google.com -p 80,443
2. python3 async_tcp_scan.py 45.33.32.156,demo.testfire.net,18.192.172.30 -p 20-25,53,80,111,135,139,443,3306,5900
```

## Application Performance
Due to the nature of Python's `asyncio` framework results such as the 
ones shown below are possible: the first 1000 TCP/IP ports of 
[scanme.nmap.org](http://scanme.nmap.org) are scanned in **1.68 seconds**:

```
eonraider@havoc:~$ python3 async_tcp_scan.py scanme.nmap.org -p 1-1000 --open

[>] Results for scanme.nmap.org:
      PORT     STATE      SERVICE      REASON   
       22       open        ssh       SYN/ACK   
       80       open        http      SYN/ACK   

Async TCP Connect scan of 1000 ports for scanme.nmap.org completed in 1.68 seconds
```

**ADVISORY:** For the sake of simplicity this application does not
implement a maximum number of workers responsible for making each
connection, instead spawning a new worker for every target socket
(i.e. combination of target address and TCP port) until the process is
complete. What this means in
practice is that performing a scan of a significant number of ports on
a single host will consequently trigger a great number of requests being
sent almost simultaneously, potentially causing an involuntary situation
analogous to that of a *SYN-flood Denial-of-Service attack* on hosts not
able to handle the sudden spike in the number of requests they have to
handle. For this particular reason, and in addition to the
[Legal Disclaimer](#legal-disclaimer) section below, **all users are
advised by the developers to use caution when scanning live hosts.**
